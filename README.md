Terminal "Rock Paper Scissors" game

I wrote this as a chance to dip my toes into C++ a little bit. The computer picks a move randomly and then you get a message telling you whether you won, lost, or tied. It also tracks how many games you've won, lost, and tied, and what your win rate is, though these stats don't persist through sessions. Enter 'r' for Rock, 'p' for Paper, 's' for Scissors, 'h' for help, or 'q' to quit.
