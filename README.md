# "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game for Linux Terminal

I wrote this as a chance to dip my toes into C++ a little bit. The computer picks a move randomly and then you get a message telling you whether you won, lost, or tied. It also tracks how many games you've won, lost, and tied, and what your win rate is, though these stats don't persist through sessions. Enter 'r' for Rock, 'p' for Paper, 's' for Scissors, 'h' for help, or 'q' to quit.

It should be trivial to compile the game yourself. Just run `g++ rps.cpp -o rps` in the directory you saved the rps.cpp file. There's also a precompiled binary for if you can't or don't want to compile yourself for whatever reason.
